Day 1 of 100 Days of Coding Challenge I've officially kicked off my 100-day journey to sharpen problem-solving skills and gear up for technical interviews. Here's a quick snapshot of today's progress:

HackerRank: C++ Input and Output

Objective: Practice reading input from stdin and printing output to stdout in C++.

Task: Read three integers from input and print their sum.

Skills: Input/output handling, basic arithmetic operations.

GeeksforGeeks: Area of a Circle

Objective: Calculate the area of a circle given its radius.

Formula: Area = π × r²

Skills: Mathematical computations, understanding geometric formulas.

GeeksforGeeks: Leap Year

Objective: Determine if a given year is a leap year.

Criteria: A year is a leap year if it's divisible by 4, but not by 100, unless it's also divisible by 400.

Skills: Conditional statements, calendar logic.

* GeeksforGeeks: Prime Number

Objective: Check if a given number is prime.

Definition: A prime number is greater than 1 and has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Skills: Looping, number theory, optimization techniques.
